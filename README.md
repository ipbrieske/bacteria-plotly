# bacteria-plotly

This project involves constructing a website to display data from a study of bellybutton bacterial diversity. By sampling the bellybuttons of various participants for different bacteria, we are able to visualize the distribution of different species over several samplings. We have displayed this data in three ways: first by a bar graph of the most populous bacteria for each participant, a gauge of self-reported bellybutton washing frequency, and a graph portraying the volume of samples organized by sampling. The site allows a user to select various participants to view their individual statistics as well as an overview of thier metadata. To make the site most engaging, I have sought to include audio and visual elements to the site. These include an overview narration, as well as a soundtrack for browsing pleasure.
